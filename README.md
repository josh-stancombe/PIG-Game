# PIG-Game
Description: 
- A simple JavaScript game. I created this game as part of my 'Complete JavaScript' course on Udemy. 

Notes: 
- I did not create the images, HTML or CSS, these were provided. The JS file is my work.

Game Rules: 
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they whish. Each result get added to their ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach the pre-defined points on GLOBAL score wins the game
